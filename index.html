			<h1 class="header">How quitting my corporate job for my startup dream f*cked my life up</h1>
		</div>
			
			<div class="content">
			Finally the SMS arrived:</br>

“Tomorrow morning 5am, flight number AZ610 from Rome to NewYork.”</br>

An SMS hitting my BlackBerry on Sunday evenings used to decide my destination and client for the coming week.</br>

I was working for one of the top three global strategy consulting firms.</br>

A life packed in a suitcase. A consulting life where you miss out on everything and everyone in life, except Excel spreadsheets. A fancy business life we are taught to be ideal slaves of, at top business schools whose degrees we are proud to hold.</br>

After few hours of sleep, the private driver was taking me to the Rome Fuimicino airport so I could take my fancy business-class flight to NYC. Upon arrival, I was checking in to a fancy five-star hotel and heading to my client’s office afterwards.</br>

The salary? It was fancy, too. The company was proud to be among the top payers of the industry.</br>

<span class="bold">Parents</span></br>

There was something wrong with this consulting life, though. I couldn’t stand this fancy bullsh*t any longer and one day I called my parents:</br>

<em>“Dad, mom, I just quit my job. I want to start my own startup.”</em></br>

My mom almost had a heart attack. It wasn’t the first thing a perfectionist mother wanted to hear after encouraging me to graduate from the world’s top business schools with top grades.</br>

I tried to ease her distress. No chance.</br>

<em>“Mom, I hate it. All these consultants are pretending to be happy and they are taking happiness pills. I get to sleep only 3–4 hours a day. All those benefits the company promised don’t exist. Remember the fancy five-star hotel? I am working almost 20 hours a day and I don’t even enjoy it. Fancy breakfast? We never have time to have that. Fancy lunch, dinner? It’s just a sandwich in front of our Excel spreadsheets. Oh, by the way, instead of enjoying a champagne, I stare at spreadsheets during my entire business class flights, too. The fancy salary? I never have time to spend a single penny of it.

I hate my life, Mom, it’s such a loser life. I don’t even see my girlfriend. I can’t fake it anymore. I want to start my own business.”</em>

My parents had retired after years of a 9–5 working routine at their secure and boring government jobs.</br>

I knew that coming from a family with no entrepreneurial background, it would be difficult to explain my situation to them, but I didn’t expect the call next morning.</br>

It was my mom on the phone:</br>

“Sooooooooo, how is your business doing?! Is it growing?!”
No matter what I said, I couldn’t explain to her that a business needs more than one day to grow.</br>

<span class="bold">Girlfriend, Friends & Social Circle</span></br>

Having had the most supportive girlfriend ever, it was now time I shared the news with my friends who were busy climbing the fancy career steps in the fancy corporate world.</br>

I told everyone that I just quit my job to follow my startup dream. Some of my friends gradually stopped seeing me, probably because they thought there was something wrong with me since it was the second “fancy” job I had quit in a short period of time.</br>

While the rest of my friends were supportive, there was, however, still something wrong with my relationship with them:</br>

I soon realized I was starting to pull myself away from social gatherings.</br>
	

	<div class="backimage2">Every time I met with those friends, I didn’t have many updates to give them in response to their repeated questions, such as, “So, how is your startup going? You are going to be the next Zuckerberg, right?” “Oh man, we are so proud of you and we are so sure you will soon receive a huge round of investment.”</br>

Doing a startup was a long journey and I was putting myself under so much pressure by giving such a f*ck about what other people think.</br>

Day by day, I was getting lonelier and more depressive as I avoided social occasions. My startup progress was not as fast as my social circle imagined it to be and I was fed up with telling people it took years for startups like Facebook and Twitter to arrive at where they are now.</br>
